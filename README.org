* Advent of Code 2019 in Clojure

This is my attempt at AoC2019 puzzles in Clojure running on Babashka.

Expect more details soon.

Notes:
Day 9 required me to change the representation of memory from a simple vector to a map
(in order to be able to access addresses beyond the initial program).
I used a sorted map to be able to test it easily against vectors,
by extracting the =vals= from it directly
(a standard map does not guarantee the order of its items).
